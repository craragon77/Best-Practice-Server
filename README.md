Best Practice is a meant for musicians to better structure, organize, and plan their rehearsals.

To use Best Practice's server, simply make an account with a valid username and password and log in. Users will be assigned a unique UUID which can then be used to make fetch requests, queries, and requests to the backend. Users can expect a suqsequent response given a valid UUID and if request parameters are met.



The backend for the program was built with Node.js, Mocha, Chai, and PostgreSQL. To deploy, simply clone the code and type "npm start" or "npm run dev" into the command line.

This program is dedicated to all musicians and artists who spend their free time devoted to improving their craft. Special thanks to my advisor Jaina Morgan for her support.
